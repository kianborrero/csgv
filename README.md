AI Productivity Website
A simple, modern web project showcasing AI-driven tools to boost productivity, featuring a responsive layout and clean UI design.

**📝 Project Summary**

This project showcases three main AI productivity tools: the AI Scheduler, which automatically schedules and manages tasks; Smart Notes, an AI-powered note-taking and organization tool; and the AutoTask Manager, which automates task tracking and prioritization. The goal was to design an attractive, user-friendly website that effectively communicates the benefits of AI in enhancing productivity.

Initial wireframes focused on a two-column layout—feature text on one side, relevant imagery on the other, maintaining high visual clarity.

Logo:
A minimalist AI-themed logo was designed to symbolize innovation and technology with a sleek, modern feel (uploaded logo image).

Color Scheme:

Background: Dark tech-patterned background for a futuristic vibe.

Primary Accent: Soft brown tones for cards and navigation to balance the dark theme.

Font: Rounded, friendly typeface that remains easy to read while giving the design a slightly playful, futuristic touch.

🎨 Bootstrap SCSS Customizations
This project uses Bootstrap but with the following custom SCSS overrides:

Primary Colors: Custom brown and dark backgrounds.

Button Styles: Rounded corners with muted hover effects.

Typography: Custom Google Fonts integration (for a softer, tech-appropriate look).

Cards and Sections: Increased padding, larger border-radius, and soft box shadows for a modern card effect.

All Bootstrap default variables were overridden in a separate SCSS file to maintain consistency across components.
